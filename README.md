## Sachin Kodagoda's Project Intro
* test_project_01

## Requeriments
* install [NodeJS] (http://nodejs.org). 
* automaically `npm` also will be installed
* npm install -g gulp

## Install
* to gather all dependencies use -> npm install


## How to use

* **default**: Compile and watch for changes
* **scripts**: Compile the JavaScript files
* **sass**: Compile the Sass styles
* **images**: Copy the newer to the build folder
* **vendors**: Copy the vendors to the build folder
* **watch**: Watch for any changes on the each section



Once you have the project running in the terminal you can delete the partial
```
sources/sass/6-pages.sass
```
It's purpose is purley to get you started and have something "schmancy" on the screen when it launches. delete it and start writing your very own "schmancy" code for your project.

If you want to use SCSS or LESS feel free to make that change in the file types and update the gulpfile to look for the right file types also.


Feel free to add onto this project by forking it and making it your own, This is just a basic start but work for most basic project without a lot of fancy bells and whistles.

Cheers 👍🏼
